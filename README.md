# All Day Study: Machine Learning & Deep Learning

## 1. Project Overview

This repository, titled all_day_study , documents my individual study of the book “혼자 공부하는 머신러닝 + 딥러닝 (Self-Study Machine Learning & Deep Learning)”.
It serves both as a record of my learning process and as a reproducible notebook series that demonstrates core ML/DL concepts through Python code.

Each notebook in this repository corresponds to a specific chapter or concept from the book, with additional annotations, experiment logs, and reflections for deeper understanding.

## 2. Learning Objectives

The primary goals of this project are:
- To systematically understand the theoretical foundations of machine learning and deep learning.
- To implement and test algorithms covered in the book using Jupyter Notebooks.
- To build an independent study workflow using Python, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Matplotlib.
- To gradually transition from textbook-level examples to self-directed projects.

This repository is not only a learning log but also a foundation for future portfolio work in data science and AI.

## 3. Study Methodology

Each chapter’s notebook includes the following structure:
1. Key Concepts Summary — concise theoretical overview.
2. Code Implementation — exercises and extended experiments.
3. Commentary — observations and reflections after execution.
4. Further Study Notes — related concepts or papers for deeper exploration.

Learning and documentation are done sequentially by topic, emphasizing both comprehension and reproducibility.

## 4. Future Direction

After completing this textbook-based series, I plan to:
- Apply the learned concepts to real-world datasets (e.g., Kaggle, UCI).
- Transition to deep learning frameworks and model optimization tasks.
- Build mini-projects for classification, regression, and clustering.
- Create visual dashboards or reports summarizing key learning milestones.

## 5. Environment
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- TensorFlow / Keras (for DL sections)
